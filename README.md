### 👋 Hi there, I’m **Tianyi Xihuanni**

- 🎓 CS graduate student  
- 🔬 Geeked out about **SCI-level research** and turning ideas into papers  
- 💰 Always testing ways to **turn code into cash**  
- 🏋️‍♂️ Side quest: make both my code *and* myself look cooler  

#### What I’m up to
- Reinforcement-learning-powered scheduling (PPO from scratch)
- Experiments in data-driven side hustles (learn ➜ ship ➜ earn)

#### Tech playground
| Domain | Skills / Learning | Looking to collaborate on |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| ML & RL | PyTorch, Gym, PPO/DQN | Paper reproduction, benchmark suites |
| Scheduling & Optimization | AGV/Job-shop, GA, heuristics | Real-world deployments, open-source |
| Data Engineering | MinIO, Kafka, Python ETL | Architecture tuning, performance boosts |

#### Motto
> **Heaven rewards the diligent.**
